" Some rules for vi init file:
" - Starting a comment line with \", apparently :)
" - No empty lines
"
" VI only option
" set noflash
"
" Options
" Vi will show tab as ^I, literally. It's not good looking.
set nolist
" Automatically indent on the next line
set autoindent
" Highlight the matching () {} when closing it.
set showmatch
" Ignore case when searching
set ignorecase
" Show messsage for edits exceeds this number of lines
set report=1
" Tab 4 spaces
set tabstop=4
" Indent 4 spaces with autoindent, >> or <<
set shiftwidth=4
" Do not line number
" In my case the cursor ignores the line number colomns in normal mode.
set nonumber
" Show mode change
set showmode
" No repeat mapping
set noremap
"
"
" Mappings with , as <leader>. Quit, edit(reload), save and more.

" Other ! mappings, does not work well for last one or two characters
" Default commented, delete and navigate in normal mode instead
